                    Hello folks!
                    <br></br>
                    My name is Aadvik Kosuru and I'm from India! I'm a 10 year old kid still in my elementary (PYP) years of school in 
                    the IB school of NES International School Mumbai. I like programming, and am currently learning how to make 
                    my Javascript better. I would say that I'm pretty good at HTML (HyperTextMarkupLanguage), and understand
                    enough CSS to create a full fledged website, like this one!
                </p>
            </div> 

            <div class="myGoals">
                <p>
                    Everyone has goals in their life. Some people want to be fishers, others astronauts. My goals, which I hope to achieve
                    are of the following:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li class="goal1"> 1.   To become the first 11 or 12 year CEO</li>
                    <li class="goal2"> 2.   To become a software engineer at a company like Google or Apple</li>
                    <li class="goal3"> 3.   To get into a university like Harvard or Yale</li>
                    <li class="goal4"> 4.   To move to and live in the U.S.A (Mainly because of the fact that I will have a full two-story house!)</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>
