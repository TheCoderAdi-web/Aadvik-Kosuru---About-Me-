        <h1>How it all started:</h1>
        <p class="startupIntoduction">
            In our school, in grade 4, I started learning about renewable energy. During Diwali (an Indian festival known as the festival of lights
            mostly celebrated by hindus), we had to create a startup business idea and present it to some judges. This experience, made me realise that
            those of even ten years old can make and run businesses. That's when I decided to make Prime Solar. Prime Solar is a business that produces and
            distributes solar panels in India, and potentially with enough growth, we could go overseas. Now, this business is still in its planning
            phases.
            The below documents show the financial and business plans for Prime Solar
